Simple app for authoring IMS Question and Test Interoperability packages. Currently very early in development, but the goal of this project is to support the creation/distribution of Open Educational Resources.

To this end, the application is intended to provide both QTI packages, which can be easily imported to *most* LMSes, but also human readable files such as PDFs which allows distribution regardless of format.
